						<h3>Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</h3>
						<p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>
						<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. <strong> Bender, hurry!</strong> <em> This fuel's expensive!</em> Also, we're dying!</p>
						<h2>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</h2>
						<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I had more, but you go ahead. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>What are their names?</li>
							<li>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.</li>
							<li>File not found.</li>
						</ol>

						<ul>
							<li>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</li>
							<li>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</li>
							<li>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</li>
